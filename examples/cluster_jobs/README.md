# Cluster Jobs

These are the scripts that run all of the trials for the analysis. They are organized as follows:

### `steady`
Scripts to run trials (background, bias tests, sensitivity) for time integrated followups

### `transient`
Scripts to run trials (background, bias tests, sensitivity) for short timescale followups

### `luminosity_constraints`
Scripts to run trials for using FIRESONG to simulate populations of neutrinos sources and compare to the performance of this analysis
